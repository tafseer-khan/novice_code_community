# Novice Coding Connetion

**Create a community forum focused on connecting novice coding learners with each other to help work through the world of coding. The project is meant to be a one stop shop for current and future coding students. A space to ask questions, share ideas, supply resources and build a support network as they move through their studies whether in a Coding Boot Camp, University or self taught.
